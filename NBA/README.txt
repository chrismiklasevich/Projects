The project is to see if there is a trend for NBA Champions to have better defensive ratings (DRtg) than offensive ratings.

This comes from the quote of Football coach, Paul Bryant: "Offense wins games, defense wins championships"

Also, the video: The MYTH that "Defense Wins Championships" (in the NBA) by MDJ

I would like to see if it is true for the NBA. I would like to scrap the data of the NBA champions from 1970 and do a paired t-test of the two ratings.

NOTE: THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE ANALYSIS OF OFFENSES AND DEFENSES. UNDERSTANDING THE DEFENSIVE CONCEPTS AND OFFENSES PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND
WHY OFFENSES AND DEFENSES' RATINGS ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

For example: ICE defense, a defensive concept to allow long 2-pointers from pick and rolls (1-2 steps within the three point line) can work wonders on 
certain teams like the 2013 Brooklyn Nets (4th seed), where Tom Thibodeau's Bulls (5th seed) won in the playoffs without Derrick Rose, MVP of 2011.
Great video explaining ICE defense from BBALLBREAKDOWN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzWRree2YlQ

This also can be terrible versus teams with a stretch big man who can stay behind the three point line and shoot three pointer at a good percentage, 
like 2019-2020 Wizards with Davis Bertans, a 6 ft 10 inch power forward who is shooting 8 three pointers a game and making 43.2 percent of them.
He would just stay behind the three point line during a pick and rolls.


The analysis will start the 1970-1971 season, since this would be the year where the NBA would be expanding into the upper teens (17 teams to be exact)
